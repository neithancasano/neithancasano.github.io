> This space holds all my rejected work. I keep them as reminders that rejection is the cost we pay trying to move our lives forward; Courage to gamble time and energy on a project we really want to work; Courage to create and build despite criticism or ridicule; Courage to express accurately; Courage to put in work even without the guarantee of reward. [Anais Nin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana%C3%AFs_Nin) saidÂ _life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage_. I wish for my life to expand.
