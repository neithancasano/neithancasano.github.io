> This space holds all my rejected work. I keep them to remind myself that rejection is a natural byproduct of taking courage to reach for something better; Courage to invest time on a thing I really want to work; Courage to create despite criticism; Courage to express myself as accurately as I can at the cost of being ridiculed; Courage to do work the best way I can. Anais Nin saidÂ _life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage_. I wish for my life to continuously expand.
