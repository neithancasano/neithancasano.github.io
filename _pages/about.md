I am currently building [Pixel Zero Digital Solutions](www.pixelzero.solutions) with my wife [Jen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2RUD6psAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), and helping out as programmer for the Penn Center for Learning Analytics under the [RPPL
Research Infrastructure for Professional Development](https://annenberg.brown.edu/rppl/about) project.

I am a part-time instructor in the [Department of Information Systems and Computer Science](https://www.facebook.com/admudiscs/) (DISCS) of the Ateneo de Manila University and have done research under the [Ateneo Laboratory for the Learning Sciences](https://alls.ateneo.edu/) (ALLS) headed by [Dr. Maria Mercedes T. Rodrigo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=meAacBIAAAAJ&hl=en)

I did data analytics work for the [WHIMC Project](https://whimcproject.web.illinois.edu/) through the partnership of ALLS with [Dr. Chad Lane](https://education.illinois.edu/faculty/h-chad-lane) and [Dr. Jeff Ginger](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/jeff-ginger) of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  

Previously, I worked with [Dr. Ivon Arroyo](https://www.umass.edu/education/people/ivon-arroyo) of the University of Massachusetts Amherst on the migration and testing of their [Wearable Learning Technologies](https://stemforall2017.videohall.com/presentations/1027) in the Philippine context. Through the support of [Dr. Xiangen Hu](https://www.memphis.edu/psychology/people/faculty/hu.php) I was also able to visit the University of Memphis to share the [mobile applications created by ALLS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Ateneo+Laboratory+for+the+Learning+Sciences) to their [Advanced Learning Theories, Technologies, Applications & Impacts](https://home.x-in-y.com/)  (ALTTAI) community. Most recently, while working on a grant received from University Research Council of ADMU, we were able to work with [Samsung R&D Institute Philippines](https://research.samsung.com/srph) (SRPH) towards the development of [a gamification system for higher education](https://xiphiasgamification.gnomio.com/), particularly geared towards computer programming classes.

I continue to publish and have maintained my interest in the following areas of research: Embodied Cognition, Game-Based Learning, Gamification, Data Analytics and Visualization and Bluetooth Low-Energy Technologies.

I regularly submit to the following Scopus-indexed publication venues: [International Conference on Computers in Education](https://icce2022.apsce.net/), [International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction](https://2022.hci.international/), and [International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education](https://aied2022.webspace.durham.ac.uk/)
